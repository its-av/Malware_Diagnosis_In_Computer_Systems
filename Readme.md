In this project, I aim to develop various Machine Learning, models using different techniques, to predict if a computer system will soon be hit with malware. The dataset used to
achieve this goal is an unprecedented telemetry dataset provided by Microsoft to encourage open-source progress on effective techniques for predicting malware occurrences.
The key point to note is that the objective is to help protect more than one billion machines from damage before it happens.

Note: requires python 3.8

How to run :-

> pip install lightgbm

>First Extract the zip file.

>Open the Malware_Diagnosis_In_Computer_Systems.ipynbï¿½ and download the train.csv from the link mentioned in the python notebook.

>Place the downloaded train.csv in the same folder as the notebook.

>Now the Notebook cells can be executed.
